# About Me
* I'm currently an Algorithm Engineer at [Apple Inc.](https://www.apple.com/) based in Bay Area, California, working on signal processing / machine learning / deep learning algorithms for various on-device applications including communications, sensing, and silicon/hardware-induced problems. My current research interets include physics-aware AI/ML algorithms and physics-inspired computing.
  
* I received my Ph.D degree from [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2022, advised by Prof. [Jin Zhou](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085426607) and Prof. [Romit Roy Choudhury](https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/) affiliated with ECE and CS. 

* My PhD research direction is two-fold, broadly in interference management techniques. 
(1) Blocker-tolerant wireless receivers for 5G/Software-defined radios. (2) Signal processing and machine learning algorithm in interference-dominant wireless/acoustics applications.
  * I look for interesting physics-aware algorithmic solutions that can do better job in various scenarios.
  * I strive to get an in-depth understanding on math/physics fundamentals including EM theory, stochastic process, signal processing & machine learning theory.

* Previously, I received my B.Eng degree with highest honors from [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/) in 2016. And, I received my M.S degree from [University of Michigan at Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/) in 2018. 

* I interned at [IBM Quantum Research](https://research.ibm.com/quantum-computing) at Yorktown Heights, NY, focusing on stochastic sub-system modeling and algorithms for quantum computing.
