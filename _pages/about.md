# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jin Zhou](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085426607) and Prof. [Romit Roy Choudhury](https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/) affiliated with ECE and CS. 
* My current research direction is two-fold, broadly in interference management. 
(1) Blocker-tolerant wireless receivers for 5G/Software-defined radios. (2) Signal processing and machine learning algorithm in interference-dominant wireless/acoustics applications.
* Previously, I received my B.Eng degree with highest honors from [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/) in 2016. And, I received my M.S degree from [University of Michigan at Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/) in 2018. 
* I always try my best to have a good theoretical understanding on fundamentals such as electromagnatics, quantum mechanics, linear algebra, stastical signal processing, and machine learning theory. While I mainly work on problems in the domain of RF/wireless/acoustics, I strive to find interesting physics-aware algorithmic solutions to bring something new and better than ones without physics/hardware understanding.
